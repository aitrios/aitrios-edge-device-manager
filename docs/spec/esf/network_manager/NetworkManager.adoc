== Purpose and Scope

This document defines the Network Manager of AITRIOS. +
It applies to version XX of XX.

<<<

== Terminology
=== Ethernet
Ethernet is a communication standard used to transmit signals over a network by connecting devices via LAN (Local Area Network) cables or other wired methods. +
In this function, it is used when connecting a device booted in Normal mode via a wired connection. +
For details on Normal mode, refer to <<#_ComponentConnectMode, Network Connection Modes>>. +
In this document, it is referred to as "Eth."

=== Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is a communication standard used to transmit signals over a network by wirelessly connecting devices. +

==== Wi-Fi Station Mode
Wi-Fi Station Mode is one of the operating modes of Wi-Fi devices, in which the device connects to a Wi-Fi access point as a client. +
In this function, it is used when connecting a device booted in Normal mode via a wireless connection. +
For details on Normal mode, refer to <<#_ComponentConnectMode, Network Connection Modes>>. +
In this document, it is referred to as "WiFi STA."

==== Wi-Fi Access Point Mode
Wi-Fi Access Point Mode is one of the operating modes of a Wi-Fi router, where the router function is disabled and it operates solely as a Wi-Fi access point. +
In this function, it is used when a device booted in AccessPoint mode is waiting for a wireless connection. +
For details on AccessPoint mode, refer to <<#_ComponentConnectMode, Network Connection Modes>>. +
In this document, it is referred to as "WiFi AP."

=== RSSI
RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) refers to the strength of the received signal, expressed as a numerical value. +
In this function, a device booted in Normal mode using Wi-Fi Station Mode obtains the signal strength received from a Wi-Fi access point or router. +
For details on RSSI in this function, refer to <<#_FunctionGetInfo, Retrieving Network Information>>. +

<<<

== Component Description
=== Component Overview
The Network Manager provides functions for controlling the network-related aspects of a device. +
When the network configuration of the OS or hardware is changed, the Network Manager handles the response. +
Below is an example of the component overview diagram. +

<<<

=== Detailed Component Description
[#_ComponentConnectMode]
==== Network Connection Modes
The Network Manager allows selection of the control network by specifying the connection type. +
It supports two types of operation: connecting to a network as a client device, and acting as a Wi-Fi Access Point that waits for external connections. +
These can be specified through the network connection mode. +
The available connection modes are listed below. +

NOTE: Wi-Fi Access Point operation is not supported. +

|===
|Network Connection Mode Name |Connection Type
|Normal Mode
|WiFi STA, Eth

|AccessPoint Mode (Not Supported)
|WiFi AP
|===

[#_ComponentProcess]
==== Network Operations
The Network Manager performs operations on network interfaces, retrieves information, and manages IP addresses. +
It provides the following three types of operations: +

* Operations using information specified by the upper layer +
* Operations using configuration retrieved from the Parameter Storage Manager +
* Operations using stored information (maintained in the Network Manager's RAM) +

For details, refer to <<#_DFD_StartSet, Data Flow Diagram: Network Startup (using configuration from Parameter Storage Manager)>> and +
<<#_DFD_StartRAM, Data Flow Diagram: Network Startup (using stored network information in RAM)>>. +

[#_ComponentWiFiStatus]
==== Network Status Notification
The Network Manager notifies the LED Manager of the network connection status and any operation errors. +
For details on notification content, refer to <<#_StatusWiFiStatus, LED Manager Status Notification>>. +

[#_ComponentNotifyInfo]
==== Network Connection Status Callback
The Network Manager calls the registered status callback function in response to changes in network connection status. +
For details on the notified states, refer to <<#_StatusNotifyInfo, Network Connection Status Notification>>. +

[#_ComponentDFD]
==== Data Flow Diagrams
The following diagrams show the network data flow for startup and shutdown in Normal mode. +
The data flow is the same for AccessPoint mode. +

* Network Startup (using configuration from Parameter Storage Manager) +

=== State Transitions
The Network Manager has the following state transitions:

* <<#_Status1, Network Manager Initialization State Transitions>> +
This describes the initialization state transition of the Network Manager. +
* <<#_Status2, Network Connection State Transitions>> +
This describes the network connection state transitions. +
Transitions occur based on network start/stop and event notifications received from the PL. +
Along with these transitions, callback notifications are sent to the application, and status notifications are sent to the LED Manager.

[#_Status1]
==== Network Manager Initialization State Transitions
The initialization states of the Network Manager are shown in <<#_TableStates1>>.

[#_TableStates1]

== Notes and Component-Specific Information

=== Limitations
* Maximum Handle Count +
  The number of Network Manager handles is limited per handle type as follows: +
  ** Control Handle: One per connection mode
  ** Info Handle: Two per connection mode

* Multiple Callback Function Registration +
  Registering multiple network connection status notification callback functions is not supported. +
  Please register only one per connection mode.

* IPv6 Support +
  IPv6 is not supported. Please use IPv4.

* DHCP Lease Period +
  DHCP lease renewal is not performed after the lease period expires.

* WiFi Encryption Method Specification +
  Specifying the WiFi encryption method is not supported. It operates with PL fixed values.

* WiFi Channel Specification +
  Specifying the WiFi channel is not supported. It operates with PL fixed values.

* Wi-Fi Access Point Mode +
  Wi-Fi Access Point Mode is not supported. +
  Please use Normal mode for network connection. +
  Do not access AccessPoint mode connection information when saving or retrieving network information.

* Proxy +
  The Network Manager only supports saving and retrieving proxy information via the Parameter Storage Manager. +
  Proxy is not used in communication initiated by Network Manager. +
  If proxy is needed, retrieve proxy info via get operation and apply it manually for the communication.
