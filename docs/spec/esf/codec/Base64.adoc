== Purpose and Scope

This document defines the Base64 functionality of the Codec module, which is an internal module of ESF in AITRIOS.  
It applies to version XX of T3S3.

<<<

== Terminology
      [Pending] Module names such as ESF and internal modules of ESF (e.g., Codec), which appear in the functional specification description, will be replaced with standardized terms once they are finalized.

=== ESF
ESF (AITRIOS Edge Software Framework) +

* A layer that provides AITRIOS-standard APIs executable from various applications.  
* It is fundamentally unaffected by changes to OS, chip, etc.  
* As it forms the core of application functionality, it is managed by SSS.  
* By modularizing in blocks, the impact of changes such as sensor replacements is minimized.

=== Codec
An internal module of ESF. +  
It provides the following functionalities using general-purpose external libraries:

** JPEG  
** QR code reading  
** Base64

=== Base64
Base64 (Base64 Data Encoding) is an encoding method that converts data into a Base64 string. +  
It primarily supports the following two functionalities:

* Standard Base64 encoding. +  
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4[Reference: RFC4648 Section 4. Base 64 Encoding]

* Base64 encoding adapted for strings usable in URLs or filenames (URL-safe or file-safe). +  
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5[Reference: RFC4648 Section 5. Base 64 Encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet]

[#_ComponentExp]
== Component Description
=== Component Overview
Base64 is one of the encoding methods used to convert various character encodings (multibyte strings) or binary data into text format. +  
The text format used is ASCII. +  
It is mainly used for transmitting data to applications or programs that can handle only text formats. +  
Base64 replaces 64 types of 6-bit data (ranging from 0 to 63) with characters within the 7-bit range. +  
The following diagram illustrates an example of Base64 encoding and decoding:

* Encoding the UTF-8 string "test" into the Base64 string "dGVzdA==" using Base64 encoding  
* Decoding the Base64 string "dGVzdA==" back into the UTF-8 string "test" using Base64 decoding

[#_Component0]
==== Component Processing (Base64 Encoding Rules)
The Base64 used in this document follows the standard Base64 character set. +  
For Base64 characters and encoding rules, refer to:  
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4[RFC4648 Table 1: The Base 64 Alphabet] +

In URL-safe or filename-safe Base64, characters suitable for use in URLs and filenames are used. +  
Specifically, the characters `-` and `_` are used in place of `+` and `/` in standard Base64. +  
For URL-safe or filename-safe Base64 characters and encoding rules, refer to: +  
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-5[RFC4648 Table 2: The "URL and Filename safe" Base 64 Alphabet] +  
Note: In version XXX, URL-safe or filename-safe Base64 is not supported.

[#_Component1]
==== Component Processing (Base64 Encoding)
[#_Component1_1]
===== Basic Base64 Encoding Process
Base64 encoding handles data in 24-bit blocks. +  
Each 24-bit block is divided into four 6-bit segments. +  
These four 6-bit values are then converted into four ASCII characters based on <<#_Component0, RFC4648 Base64 Encoding Rules>>. +

[#_Component1_2]
===== About Padding Characters
When encoding data that is not a multiple of 3 bytes, the resulting Base64 output may contain fewer than 4 characters. +  
In such cases, padding characters (`=` symbols) are added so that the result is always 4 characters long.

[#_Component1_3]
===== When Splitting Data for Base64 Encoding
When handling large data by splitting it into smaller chunks for Base64 encoding, each chunk should be a multiple of 3 bytes. +  
If data is split at lengths not divisible by 3, padding may be added to the end of each chunk, which can result in incorrect decoding.

<<<

``** size_t EsfCodecBase64GetDecodeSize( size_t in_size )**``

* *Parameter Description* +  
+
**``[IN] size_t in_size``**::  
The size (in bytes) of the Base64-encoded input string. The null terminator is not included. +  
** Must be an integer between 2 and ESF_BASE64_MAX_SIZE.

+  
Returns the size (in bytes) of the decoded data.

Specifies the value of ``**in_size**`` and calculates the corresponding decoded data size.  
The result is returned as the return value. +
[#_SampleFunction6_1]
** This API cannot calculate the exact decoded data size +  
In Base64 decoding, padding characters are excluded from the final decoded result. +  
However, since this API cannot determine the number of padding characters, it does not exclude them in the calculation. +  
Therefore, the actual decoded data size may be 1 or 2 bytes smaller than the value returned by this API. +  
To get the exact size, use the [OUT] ``**out_size**`` value from <<#_SampleFunction2, Base64 decoding>>.

** About the Maximum Size of Decoded Data +  
The maximum decoded data size is calculated by subtracting the null terminator from the maximum Base64-encoded string size and converting it with a factor of 3/4. +  
See <<#_SampleFunction5_1, Maximum value for Base64-encoded string size>> for details. +  
The formula is as follows: +  

  Maximum decoded data size = (Max encoded string size - 1) * 3 / 4  

  Maximum decoded data size = (((ESF_BASE64_MAX_SIZE - 1) / 4) * 4 + 1 - 1) * 3 / 4

** Operational Information  
*** Can be called concurrently.  
*** Can be called from multiple threads.  
*** Can be called from multiple tasks.  
*** Does not perform blocking internally.  
*** Returns the decoded data size.

** Common Error Behavior
